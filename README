grace-gtk - GTK+ bindings for Grace

grace-gtk provides GTK+ bindings for Grace, intended to be used with the
Minigrace compiler. These bindings are TOTALLY UNSUPPORTED. To build,
run `make`: you may need to specify some of the variables defined at the
top of the makefile for your system. <doc/platform> gives some notes on
what may be required.

The script generates a subset of the full GTK+ API automatically,
determined by what it knows how to translate back and forth, and
available from the dynamic module "gtk". There is a simple example
script in the repository creating a "Hello world" window.

Binding modules for "gdk" and "cairo" are also generated. Both of these
modules must be found in order for gtk to import correctly, but neither
needs to be imported directly if not desired. Two examples using Cairo
to draw pictures are in drawing.grace (for GTK+ 3) and drawing2.grace
(for GTK+ 2).
