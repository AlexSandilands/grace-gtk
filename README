grace-gtk - GTK+ bindings for Grace

grace-gtk provides GTK+ bindings for Grace, intended to be used with the
Minigrace compiler. These bindings are TOTALLY UNSUPPORTED. To build,
run `make`: you may need to specify some of the variables defined at the
top of the makefile for your system.

The script generates a subset of the full GTK+ API automatically,
determined by what it knows how to translate back and forth, and
available from the dynamic module "gtk". There is a simple example
script in the repository creating a "Hello world" window.
