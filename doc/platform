configure accepts several options, listed with configure --help, which
correspond to variables in the makefile. Options set with configure are
saved in Makefile.conf for future compilations. configure will usually
prompt you to specify values it detects as non-default.

`make` also accepts variables on the command line:
  make SOME_VAR=value

For example, to specify the location of your minigrace build (if it is
not in ../minigrace), you can use:
  make MINIGRACE_HEADERS=/path/to/minigrace

Python
------
If "python3" does not exist on your system, specify either
PYTHON_VERSION (must be 2.6 or higher) or PYTHON as the full executable
name. configure will attempt to find a suitable Python version
automatically.

GTK+
----
The bindings are currently compatible with both GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3. GTK+
3 is recommended. To use GTK+ 2 set GTK_VERSION=2.0. If your GTK+
headers are in a non-standard location, set HEADER_LOCATION to the path
including the "gtk-x.0" part or pass that path to configure --gtk-headers.

Mac OS X
--------
You will need to install the Command-Line Tools from XCode. These are
available under "Downloads" in XCode's Preferences pane.

To install GTK+ you can use Homebrew: <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>
`brew install gtk+3` will download and install the latest packaged GTK+
3 and its dependencies.

You will also need X11.app or XQuartz: <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/>.

The PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable will need to be set when compiling
grace-gtk. It is not required when only using the modules that have
already been built. Use this command (in bash) to set it correctly:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=`brew --prefix cairo`/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/X11/lib/pkgconfig

Because Homebrew installs headers into /usr/local you will need to use
at least the following configure flags:
  --include-dir /usr/local/include --cairo-headers `brew --prefix cairo`/include

An example configure command line might be:
  ./configure --python python2.7 --include-dir /usr/local/include
    --cairo-headers `brew --prefix cairo`/include
